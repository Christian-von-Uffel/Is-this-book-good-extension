# Notes

## Creating CSS Styles in Javascript
the styles javascript file creates the overlay on the page.

apparently you can simply just write a function that lets you style some classes with normal javascript and then run it

it's probably safest to create the file first as css then create a sample html page where you can run the file separately

this will let you test the css styling in a way that still enables you to easily spot errors in css syntax

afterwards you can easily rename the filename from .css to .js and then append the initial javascript function initialization

from there you're golden

## What browserAction does

It hard to know what browserAction does ATM. It's obvious that when paired with "".onclick" that it can be used to detect clicks that can perform other actions like opening up a website in a new tab
