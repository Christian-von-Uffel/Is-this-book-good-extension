# Notes

## Creating CSS Styles in Javascript
the styles javascript file creates the overlay on the page.

apparently you can simply just write a function that lets you style some classes with normal javascript and then run it

it's probably safest to create the file first as css then create a sample html page where you can run the file separately

this will let you test the css styling in a way that still enables you to easily spot errors in css syntax

afterwards you can easily rename the filename from .css to .js and then append the initial javascript function initialization

from there you're golden
