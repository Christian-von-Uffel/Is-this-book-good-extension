# Is this book good? for Google Chrome

Tired of regretting bad book purchases?

We are too, and after repeating the same process over and over again to filter out potentially bad book purchases, we decided to built a tool that would do this for us instead.

We know that it's not possible to "know" if a book is "good" before we read it, but by looking out negative signals we can help answer this fundamental question: "Is this book good?"

Is This Book Good

_Soon it will be published in the Chrome Web Store_, but until then you can install it yourself without any coding experience.

**How to Install the extension**

1. Click the 'clone or download' dropdown in the top right of this screen
2. Choose 'download ZIP'
3. Unzip the file (double click) and move the unpacked folder somewhere safe
4. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in the URL bar
5. Ensure 'developer mode' is enabled in the top right corner
6. Click 'Load Unpacked' on the top left and navigate to the folder you unzipped
7. Click to 'select' the entire root folder, not any specific files
8. You're all set! As you navigate the web, we'll point out shady marketing
