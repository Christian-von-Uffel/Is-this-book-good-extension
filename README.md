# Is this book good? for Google Chrome

Tired of regretting bad book purchases?

We are too, and after repeating the same process over and over again to filter out potentially bad book purchases, we decided to built a tool that would do this for us instead.

We know that it's not possible to "know" if a book is "good" before we read it, but by looking out for negative signals in review data we can help answer this fundamental question: "Is this book good?"

There are 3 ways Is This Book Good tries to give users more context on how to make their book ourchasing decisions.

Firstly, we try to correct for a positive bias that currently exists towards books that have a high rating and a low number of reviews.

To address this, we calculate the buyer success rate, which factors in the number of reviews a book has.

We use a simple formula for this called "Rule of Succession". You can read more about this here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_succession

Next, we address another source of bias in review ratings: recency.

Since books are more likely to receive favorable reviews when they are new, we bring attention to how long ago the book came out.

Third, and lastly, we try to address the hidden sources of book buyer frustation by bring attention to 1-star reviews.

Is This Book Good will soon be published in the Chrome Web Store, but until then you can install it yourself without any coding experience.
